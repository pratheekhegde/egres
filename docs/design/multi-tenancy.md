*Status: A namespace with a budget is paced at `maybeYield` (CPU nanoseconds and disk pages, one-second window) or fails the statement (live bytes). A cap of zero is uncapped. Every namespace starts that way, until `budget` on the admin port sets one.*

Egres is a single process, using a custom designed coroutine system called
[zfiber][]. zfiber spawns as many threads as the number of logical cores, and
cooperatively schedules fibers across these threads. All work across the
database: connections, queries, WAL, compactions, disk and network I/O are run
using these fibers.

## Cpu Ticks and zfiber

zfiber is custom-built to the needs of a database. It is different from Go's
goroutines or Rust's Tokio in that it allows certain fibers to have higher
priority than others. For example, the fibers running Raft loops get higher
priority and are chosen over others if ready and waiting. zfiber also supports
dedicated lanes (dedicated threads) that fibers can't cross. So a very heavy
query workload would not spill into the threads serving the Raft fibers.

zfiber threads have local task queues and run task stealing so no thread sits
idle while another has a queue. While zfiber doesn't natively evict a running
fiber, functions in Egres run a `maybeYield` call which can be used to
optionally yield a fiber. zfiber tracks CPU ticks spent per fiber so it can tell
how much CPU a query took.

## Direct I/O

Egres does direct I/O, bypassing the filesystem cache. It stores the blocks it
reads in an [S3-FIFO cache][s3-fifo] instead of relying on the page cache. All
storage I/O goes through a virtual filesystem API, which can meter the traffic
to a device and throttle disk IOPS as needed. Egres runs a quick calibration on
boot to figure out each device's bandwidth, or it can be fed that bandwidth via
command line flags. It also calculates the cost of a write as a factor of the
cost of a read, so it can charge reads and writes accordingly.

Any disk activity causes a fiber to park and wait for the I/O completion,
meanwhile other fibers can run on the threads. zfiber uses Mitchell Hashimoto's
[libxev][] which provides io_uring on Linux.

Disk operations are throttled by priority. A namespace with an iops cap
is also paced at `maybeYield`. Inspired by the [SILK paper][silk], disk
operations carry one of 3 priorities:
P0 is for queries, P1 for L0 flushes, and P2 for L1+ compactions. Knowing the
full bandwidth of the disk, lower priorities get the bandwidth the higher ones
leave unused. Thus, background compactions don't interfere with queries, and
query latencies stay low even with many compactors running at the same time.
The same mechanisms could be applied to object storage, based on the number of
pending requests in addition to bandwidth.

## Memory

All memory is allocated via a custom allocator, a thin wrapper over jemalloc,
which Zig's allocator interface makes easy to do. A memory governor tracks live
memory against the total memory allocated to the process. Every 100ms it sizes
the block cache up and down to make room for queries and background tasks,
keeping the process under its specified memory cap.

The process total is still what the governor reads. A statement also
charges allocations to its namespace, and `maybeYield` fails that
statement with an out-of-memory error when the namespace is over its
memory cap. CPU and disk pages park until the one-second window turns.

## One Process: Thousands of Tenants

Given these mechanisms, a namespace with a budget is metered for the CPU
ticks it spends, the memory it holds, and the disk pages it reads and
writes. That allows thousands of tenants to share resources, without any
noisy neighbor problem, and without running a VM per tenant.

## MicroVMs

Beyond resource management, Neon and AlloyDB wrap each Postgres in a microVM for
two reasons, which don't directly apply to Egres.

The first reason is best phrased by [AlloyDB][alloydb-arch]: "shared allocations
mean shared fate". Postgres's memory cannot be capped from outside, so a cgroup
limit means the [OOM killer][oom-kill] takes the postmaster down and every
tenant with it. In Egres, running out of a resource is a function error, which
can be treated like every other error and returned all the way back to the user.
Tenants share the resources but do not share the fate.

The second is security. Postgres has no boundary inside the process: extensions
are C running with the engine's full power, and a memory-safety bug in that
code, reached through one tenant's input, reaches every tenant's data. A VM per
tenant puts a kernel between them.

Egres is one process too, so what it does instead is shrink the attack surface.
A client can send only SQL, a session is bound to one database at connection
time (auth coming in future release), and no tenant native code runs in the
process. Extensions will be compiled into the engine rather than loaded at
runtime, and user-defined functions, likely WebAssembly, will run in a sandbox
metered like any other fiber. That is the bet every multi-tenant web service
makes: a small surface instead of a kernel per customer.
